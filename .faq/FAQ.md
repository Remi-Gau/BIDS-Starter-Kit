# Frequently Asked Questions

As this starter-kit grows it gets harder to know where to find information,
so this page is a collection of frequently asked questions.

Please add to this list!

It will always be ðŸš§ **in construction** ðŸš§
and we really encourage everyone to update it to be more useful.
If there's a question you've asked or answered more than twice
then it's an FAQ and it should be in the repository.

Ideally the questions will link to an answer elsewhere in the repository
to maximise the different ways of finding out more about BIDS.

```{note}
For questions related to the BIDS apps,
please visit [the BIDS apps website](https://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/dev_faq/).
