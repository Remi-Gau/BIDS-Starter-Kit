If you want to know more about what license to choose for your dataset,
see the [turing way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-data.html#data-licenses)
page dedicated to this topic.

If you plan to put your dataset on [openneuro](https://openneuro.org/),
you should use a CC0 or a PDDL license as explained in their [FAQ](https://openneuro.org/faq).
